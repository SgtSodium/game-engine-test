Trying out a Game Engine

My goal is to create a simple application that should familiarize me with an engine's features.

This simple application should have the following:
- A monocolor background which changes to a random color whenever I press the spacebar OR click the mouse within the window, and only if the window is active. The color only changes once, even if the spacebar/mouse is held.
- An arrow in the center of the screen, whose color is the inverse of the background so as to always remain visible.
- The arrow should always point towards the mouse (or if the mouse is inside the arrow's graphic, in the direction of the mouse from the center of the arrow.)
- The arrow should shrink as the mouse approaches, and grow as the mouse moves away. (Within a given range of size.)
- The user should be able to drag and drop the arrow anywhere within the window using the mouse.
- Sound effects should play on startup, whenever the spacebar is pressed, and whenever the mouse is clicked.
- Music should play so long as the 'M' key is held, and doing so should not inhibit any of the processes/interactions described above.
